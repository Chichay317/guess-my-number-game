// When using addEventListener, the first argument you pass is the type of the event
  // After passing the type of event, you pass the reaction you want to get after clicking through a function
  // The function is called the event handler
  // We do not call the function
// When we get something from a user interface e.g an input, the value is usually a string
// To compare a number with a number, first convert the string to a number
// We use math.trunc to remove the decimals of a decimal number
// Math is an object with so many methods. random is just one of the methods
// Whenever we are manipulating a style, we always need to specify a string
// The first step of refactoring is to identify duplicate code
